Thanawya Amma Dashboard Project
Project Overview

This project visualizes the performance of high school students in Egypt based on the Thanawya Amma exam results from 2022. The dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of student outcomes, demographics, and key performance indicators. The aim is to provide stakeholders with insights into student performance trends across various branches, regions, and subjects.
Data Sources

The primary dataset used in this project was sourced from[ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedahmedx2/high-school-public-results-2022-eg). It contains the public results of Egyptian high school students for the year 2022, including student scores, branch of study, gender, and location details. The data covers a broad spectrum of educational branches and geographic regions within Egypt.
Key Components of the Dashboard

    Total Students Breakdown:
        Total students are categorized by government and status (pass/fail).

    Average Percentage by Branch and Gender:
        The chart displays the average score percentage across different branches (e.g., Science, Literature) and separates data by gender.

    Performance by Subject:
        Average scores across various subjects are visualized to identify high-performing and low-performing subjects.

    Top 10 Students:
        A table listing the top ten students based on their total scores, along with their respective percentages and scores.

    Score Distribution:
        Graphs showing the distribution of student scores, with a special focus on those who scored above 90% and those who barely passed (50-60% range).

    Pass Rates by Branch and Region:
        A detailed visualization showing pass rates across different branches (e.g., Science, Arts) and geographic areas.

    Student Score Density:
        A bar chart representing the number of students in each governorate (region), allowing for comparison of student density across regions.

    Home and Abroad Students:
        Analysis of students studying abroad compared to those within the country.

    Comparison of Results (2022 vs. 2024 Projections):
        Comparative graphs projecting student performance over time and visualizing changes between 2022 and 2024.

Methodology

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The raw data from Kaggle was cleaned to remove any inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values.
    Visualization: The Excel dashboard utilizes various types of charts (bar, line, pie, histograms) to represent the data clearly and intuitively. Conditional formatting is used for quick visual interpretation of performance metrics.

Key Features

    Interactivity: Users can interact with certain charts to filter data by specific branches or regions.
    Comparative Analysis: The project also offers projections for future performance (e.g., 2024 results) based on past trends.

How to Use

    Open the Excel Dashboard: The dashboard can be opened directly in Excel. Ensure that the macros and data connections are enabled to view the data correctly.
    Navigate the Dashboard: Users can explore various charts and graphs, focusing on different branches, regions, or subjects for a more granular view of the data.
    Compare Results: The comparison charts allow users to see how student results may change over time, providing useful insights for policymakers or educators.
